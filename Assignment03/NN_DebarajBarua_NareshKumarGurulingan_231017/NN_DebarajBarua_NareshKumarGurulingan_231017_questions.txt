Q: Define learning in ANN.
A: Learning is a process by which the free parameters of a neural network are adapted in an desired way through a process of stimulation by the environment in which the network is embedded.

Q: List out the different Learning Rules.
A: 
(i)    Error-correction Learning (or, Widrow-Hoff; or, Delta Rule),
(ii)   Memory-based learning,
(iii)  Hebbian learning,
(iv)   Competitive learning,
(v)    Boltzmann learning.

Q: List a difference between Hebbian and Competitive Learning.
A: In Competitive learning only a single output neuron is active at one time. Unlike this, in Hebbian learning, several output neurons may be active at the same time.
