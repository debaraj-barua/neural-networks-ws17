Q: List three characteristics of a mulit-layer perceptron.
A: 
(i) 	Non-linear activation function
(ii)	Hidden Neurons:The netowrk contains one or more layyers of hidden neurons that are not part of the input or output of the network.
(iii)	Connectivity: Network exhibits high degrees of connectivity determined by the synapses of the net-
work.

Q: List out the different Modes of Training. Which is generally preferred and why?
A: 
(i)    Sequential Mode (online, pattern or stochastic mode)
(ii)   Batch Mode
Although sequential mode has several disadvantages, however, it is still popular because:
– Simple to implement.
– Provides effective solution to large and difficult problems.

Q: What heuristics can be applied to the learning rates to imporove Back-propagation algorithm?
A: 
- Every weight should have it’s own learning rate
– Every learning rate should be allowed to vary from one iteration to the next.
