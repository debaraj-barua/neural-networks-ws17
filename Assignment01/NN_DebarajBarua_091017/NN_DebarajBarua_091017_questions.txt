Q: What are the benefits of Neural Network?
A:
(i)    Nonlinearity,
(ii)   Input-Output Mapping,
(iii)  Adaptivity,
(iv)   Evedential Response,
(v)    Contextual Information,
(vi)   Fault Tolerance,
(vii)  VLSI Implementability,
(viii) Uniformity of Analysis and Design,
(ix)   Neurobiological Analogy

Q: What are the Rules for knowledge representation?
A: 
(i)  Similar inputs from similar classes should usually produce similar representa- tions inside the network, and should therefore be classified as belonging to the same category
(ii)  Items to be categorized as separate classes should be given widely differeent representations in the network
(iii) If a particular feature is important then there should be a large number of neurons involved in the representation of that item in the network
(iv)  Prior information and invariances should be built into the design of a neural network, thereby simplifying the network design by not having to learn them


Q: What are basic elements of a neuron?
A: 
(i)   Synapses/Connecting Links, which are Characterized by weights
(ii)  Adder, which sums input signals, constitues a linear combiner 
(iii) Activation Function/Squashing Function, which limits amplitude of the output of a neuron
      Types:
        Threshold Function
        Piecewise-Linear Function
        Sigmoid Function
