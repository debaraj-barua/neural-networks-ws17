Q: What are Self Organized Maps?
A:
Self Organizing Maps (SOM) are a neural network model for unsupervised learning, which combine a competitive learning principle with a topological structuring of neurons such that adjacent neurons tend to have similar weight vectors.

Q: What are the three essential processes of the SOM algorithm?
A:
- Competition
- Cooperation
- Weight Adaptation

Q: Summarize the Various steps in the SOM Training Algorithm.
A: 
- Intialization: Choosing random small values for weight vectors.
- Sampling: Drawing a sample from the input space.
- Similarity Matching: Finding the best matching winning neuron.
- Updating: Adjust synaptic weight vector of all neurons in the iteratively decreasing neighbourhood of the winning neuron using a learning rate which is also iteratively decreasing.
- Continuation: Continue from sampling step until no noticable changes in feature map are observed
